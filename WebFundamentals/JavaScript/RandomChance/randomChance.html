        This function, "bigMoneyBigMoney", takes an integer input, "quarters", and loops for that number of times. 
        The function sets a random, static number as "winningNumber", and sets a "winnings" variable to keep track
        of the user's total 'pot' of money before it starts to loop.
        
        On each loop, the function:
            -   Decrements the input value, "quarters", by 1.
            -   Generates a random number, "yourNumber", and compares it to winningNumber.
            -   If yourNumber does not equal winningNumber, the loop continues until the value of quarters reaches 0.
            -   If yourNumber === winningNumber, the user gets a "reward" of a random value between 50â€“100 
                determined by "reward", and continues to loop until the value of quarters reaches 0.
            -   When the user has run out of quarters (i.e., quarters === 0), the function returns 0.

    <h1>Random Chance</h1>
    <p>Let's play the slots!</p>
    <p>Make a function that takes a number of quarters (1 quarter = 1 game).</p>
    <p>There is a 1 in 100 chance to win the slot machine (which will give you between 50 - 100 quarters -- use Math.random and Math.floor to pick a random number of coins).</p>
    <p>While the user still has quarters, use Math.random to determine if they won.</p>
    <p>If they ever win, return the number of quarters (ex: they had 50 remaining quarters and won 90, so it should return 140).</p>
    <p>Return 0 if all the quarters were wasted.</p>
    <h2>To play:</h2>
    <p>Open the JavaScript console in your browser/interpreter and enter: <b>bigMoneybigMoney(***);</b></p>
    <p>where *** is the number of quarters you want to play.</p>
    <!--<p>Bonus (Only If You Have Time):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Let the user pass the number they are willing to leave with</li>
        <li>(ex: If they won the lottery and still have 40 coins, they will keep playing until they have collected 200 coins)</li>
    </ul>-->
