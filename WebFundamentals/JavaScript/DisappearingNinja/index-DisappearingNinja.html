<h1>Assignment: Disappearing Ninja</h1>
<p>Create a simple HTML page with 8 images of equal width and height (you can use any image you like). When a particular image is clicked, have that image disappear. Also, include a button on the bottom of the page called 'Restore'. When the button is clicked, all images will appear.</p>
<p><i>Don't spend more than 3 hours trying to get this to work.</i></p>
