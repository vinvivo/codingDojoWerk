    <h1>For a Few Billion</h1>
    <p>There is an old tale about a king who offered a servant $10,000 as a reward. The servant instead asked that for 30 days he be given an amount that would double, starting with a penny. (1 penny for the first day, 2 for the second, 4 for the third,
        then 8, 16, 32 pennies, and so on).</p>
    <p>Use for loops to answer the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How much was the reward after 30 days?</li>
        <li>How many days would it take to make $10,000?</li>
        <li>How many days would it take to make 1 billion?</li>
        <li><i>(To find out, view the JavaScript console in your browser.)</i></li>
