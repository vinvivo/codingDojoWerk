<!-- 
    Assignment: Ninja Class
    Create a new class called Ninja with the following attributes:
        name
        health
        speed (private)
        strength (private)

    Speed and strength should be 3 by default. Health should be 100 by default.

    The Ninja class should have the following methods:
        sayName() - This should log that Ninja's name to the console.
        showStats() - This should show the Ninja's Strength and Speed, as well as their health.
        drinkSake() - This should add +10 Health to the Ninja

    Example Outputs
        var ninja1 = new Ninja("Hyabusa");
        ninja1.sayName();
        // -> "My ninja name is Hayabusa!"

        ninja1.showStats();
        // -> "Name: Hayabusa, Health: 100, Speed: 3, Strength: 3"


    Assignment: Ninja Class II
    Complete the below challenges using the Ninja Class from the previous assignment.

    .punch()
    Add a new method to your Ninja class called .punch(). This method will take another Ninja instance and subtract 5 Health from the Ninja we passed in. Your .punch() should display a console message like the below example.
        var blue_ninja = new Ninja("Goemon");
        var red_ninja = new Ninja("Bill Gates");
        red_ninja.punch(blue_ninja);
        // -> "Goemon was punched by Bill Gates and lost 5 Health!"

    .kick()
    Now add a method to your Ninja class called .kick(). Kick will subtract 15 Health for each point of Strength the calling Ninja has, and like .punch() will take another Ninja instance.
        blue_ninja.kick(red_ninja);
        // -> "Bill Gates was kicked by Goemon and lost 15 Health!"

    Validations
    Update .punch() and .kick() so that they only accept Instances of the Ninja class. Hint: You will need to find a way to check the constructor of an instance. You will often need to consult outside documentation to find solutions for particular features.
