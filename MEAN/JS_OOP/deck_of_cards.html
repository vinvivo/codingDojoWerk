    Assignment: Deck of Cards
    Create a Deck class. A deck should have the following functionality:
        The Deck should contain the 52 standard cards
        The Deck should be able to shuffle <https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/>
        The Deck should be able to reset
        The Deck should be able to deal a random card
        Deal should return the card that was dealt and remove it from the deck

    Now create a Player class. A Player should have the following functionality:
        The Player should have a name
        The Player should have a hand
        The Player should be able to take a card (use the deck.deal method)
        The Player should be able to discard a card
    
    Optional:
        Create a blackjack game with your deck of cards!
