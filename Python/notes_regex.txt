A good resource for you to get familiar with Regex is regex.org

Here is a cheat sheet for expressions you'll be using regularly:
    '^'    Matches the following characters at the beginning of a string. Example: '^a' matches        'anna' but not 'banana'.
    '$'     Matches the previous characters at the end of a string. Example: 'a$' matches 'anna'        and 'banana' but not 'fan'.
    '[]'    Matches any value in a range. Example: '[0-9]' matches '9' and '9s'.
    '{n}' Matches n number or more repetitions of the preceding pattern. Example: '[0-9]{2}' matches '91' and '9834' but not '9'
    \d Matches digits.  Example: "\d" matches "8" and "877x"
    \w Matches characters.
