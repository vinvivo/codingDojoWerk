''' Assignment: Landing Page
    Create a flask project capable of handling the following routes.

    localhost:5000/    
        This route should serve a view file called index.html and display a
        greeting. This will be considered our 'root route'.

    localhost:5000/ninjas    
        This route should serve a view file called ninjas.html and display
        information about ninjas.

    localhost:5000/dojos/new    
        This route should serve a view file called dojos.html and have a form.
        Don't worry where the form should be sent to for now, you can simply
        set your action blank, like this:action=''.

    Next Steps
        Create a folder inside of your project labeled static. This static
        folder will be used to serve all of our static content, such as
        stylesheets, images, and javascript files! Now place a stylesheet in
        the static folder and reference it in your view files (templates).
